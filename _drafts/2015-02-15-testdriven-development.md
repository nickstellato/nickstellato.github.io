# Python Test-Driven Development

As I am starting to learn more and more about python, I am starting to think that test-drive development is the way to go. It has come to my attention that it is better to run tests one by one before determining where to go next.

Additionally, it works better with the way that I think. I like the laying out of tests as a sudo task based system. The tests describe what to do next and then shows whether they exist or not.

Now, I am trying to figure out how it all works. Testing seems to be a way to get your foot in the door with the web development world. Writing good tests.
