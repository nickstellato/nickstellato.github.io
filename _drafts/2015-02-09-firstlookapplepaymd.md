#First Look:  Apple Pay

I picked up my iPhone 6+ two days after I returned from a flight home from Las Vegas. Fortunately, Vegas had been relatively easy on me and I was able to purchase the phone with some well earned money.

Recently, I tried my hand at paying for a few things at Walgreens. I purposely avoided the various CVS Pharmacies on the way home in order to pay with Apple Pay.

Overall the process was painless. The clerk began ringing up my items and putting them into the bag. Before the clerk had finished, I put my iPhone 6+ up to the terminal and pressed my finger onto the touch ID sensor on the phone. The payment was registered. I originally thought that was where the transaction would end.

Unfortunatley, Walgreens felt that I needed to donate money to a charity. Therefore, I had to select yes/no on the keypad. Then I had to enter my pin. Finally, I had to select whether I wanted cash back. Once the purchase was completed, the register printed a reciept that required binding.

## Things to Change

1. Reduce the multiple factors of authentication.

I think that a fingerprint should be enough. I do not want to have to enter my pin code for my debit card everytime I have to pay for something. I am not sure if this is Apple's fault or if this is a bank requirement that they will not be able to get rid of.

2. Stop printing huge receipts

My email address is stored in my phone. If Walgrees was smart, they would not print a huge receipt that I am going to throw away. They would find someway to get  my email address off the phone and send the receipt that way. Kill two birds with one stone. Get an email address and make my life easier.
