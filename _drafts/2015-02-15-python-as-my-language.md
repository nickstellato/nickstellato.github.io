# Python As My Language

I have heard before that python is one of the best beginner languages. I am finding that this is true, when it comes to being able to work with both the back-end and the front-end.

## In The Beginning...

I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I understood the idea of putting words, paint and then movement in the browser. Setting up a server to work with JavaScript at the beginning was annoying, but in the end it worked out. I liked making things simple and easy to understand.

## Next Step

The next step is understaning the back-end. Working with third-party APIs make things more interesting to me. Dynamic data is what the web is now built on. I started trying to use NodeJS for realt-time dynamnic data, but it proved to not have what I wanted.

## Why Python

The interoperability of working with Python in the browser and on the desktop is what excites me in the end. I like working in the browser, but I enjoy working on the desktop. I am not sure why I like the idea of working in the desktop considering the desktop is moving away, but it still makes me think that it is something important to consider.
